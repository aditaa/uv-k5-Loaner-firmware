## Loaner Firmware Alpha 4 â€“ LNR24A4

- Force MR channels to render names (or the `CH-###` fallback) on the main screen so end users no longer see raw transmit frequencies.
- Default new boots to name display mode (`MDF_NAME`) regardless of prior EEPROM values, keeping radios aligned with the locked channel-only experience.
